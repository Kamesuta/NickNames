# NickNames

A simple nick name plugin I wrote for my server. This plugin is standalone and has several cool features not seen in other nick naming plugins.

## Installation

For now: download the .jar file found in target. I will streamline this eventually.

## Usage

### Commands

####/nick
`/nick [Player] [New Name]` - Changes the target player's display name to the new name. Supports [these color codes](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/server-support/tutorials-and-faqs/1940467-bukkit-colour-codes)  
`/nick [New Name]` - Same as above, but a shortcut to change your own display name.

####/color & /colour

__NOTE: /color and /colour both work in all below commands.__

`/color list` - Lists availiable colours.  
`/color [Player] [Color]` - Changes the colour of the target player. Name is unchanged, only the colour changes.  
`/color [Color]` - Same as above, but a shortcut to change your own colour.  

####/reset
`/reset [Player]` - Resets a given player's name to the default minecraft name.  
`/reset` - Resets your name.  

####/realnicks
`/realnicks` - Lists online players, showing both their display name and their true identity.
